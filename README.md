Virtual fly box

I developed this tool to fulfill my Sinatra final project for my Flatiron Bootcamp course. This was my first project implementing full user login functionality and true MVC methods. This project was also developed to showcase my progress working with relational database structures and objects. 

The virtual fly box tool is made up user objects, fly box objects, and fly objects. A user can have many fly boxes and flies, a fly box can have many flies but belongs to a single user, and flies belong to many fly boxes. A user has full control over all of their fly boxes and flies allowing them to create, read, update, and delete any of flies or boxes. 

To Install:
Fork and clone this repo and run bundle install from your project directory. Once bundle has completed, enter shotgun into the command line and follow the onscreen instructions.
